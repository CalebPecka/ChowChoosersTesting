# ChowChoosersTesting

This project is a series of JUnit tests created for our CSCI4830 group project, Chow Choosers. These tests will only run properly if the user updates their chromedriver.exe to their corresponding chrome version, as well as update parameters related to their version of MacOs/Windows. The tests are not guaranteed to work after making these changes. Chrome version 96 was used for this project (Windows operating system).
